Out here in the dusty frontier, word travels fast - and rumor has it some greenhorn done left their Redis instance ridin' solo out in the open prairie... no sheriff, no fence, not even a tumbleweed in sight. || Now, in these parts, exposin' a Redis server to the wildâ€™s as dangerous as leavin' the saloon doors open with the gold sittin' on the counter. What could go wrong, you ask? Maybe nothin'... or maybe some outlaw with a keen eye and quick fingers might just mosey on in and rustle up more than their fair share. || Reckon you've got what it takes to poke around and show 'em what happens when you forget to lock the barn after the horses bolt? || We will reveal our exploit script once the intended vulnerability is patched and disclosed by Redis.
